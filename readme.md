Elixir must be installed on your machine : [see here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

To launch the greetings script, in a terminal :
    - `iex` to open Elixir shell.
    - `c(challenge_1.ex)` to compile the greetings script.
    - `Challenge1.ask` will play the greetings script.
    - `ctrl + c` to leave the shell.

To play to the guessing game, in a terminal :
    - `iex` to open Elixir shell.
    - `c(guessing_game.ex)` to compile the guessing game.
    - `GuessingGame.guess(min, max)` where `min` and `max` are numbers. This will launch the guessing game where the computer will try to find the value you are thinking of, between the minimum and maximum values you entered. If the computer is correct, type `yes` in the terminal. If not type `bigger`, in case the number you're thinking of is higher, or `smaller`, if it's lower, to help him a little.
    - `ctrl + c` to leave the shell.
